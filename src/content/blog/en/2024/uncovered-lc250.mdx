Recently, Toyota officially announced the Land Cruiser 250. This new model has been developed as the successor to the Land Cruiser Prado and will play a significant role in both the Japanese and global markets. It is also planned for release in the American market.

## Main Features of the Land Cruiser 250

This vehicle uses the same platform as the Land Cruiser 300 and is equipped with the traditional 2.8L diesel engine, in addition to a new 2.7L gasoline engine. A mild hybrid engine option is expected to be available in the future.

## Current Market Situation

Like with the Land Cruiser 70, there are not many options for genuine body-on-frame vehicles in the Japanese new car market.

- Land Cruiser 70
- Land Cruiser 250
- Land Cruiser 300
- Lexus GX550 (shares platform with 250, 300)
- Lexus LX600 (shares platform with 300)
- Hilux
- Mitsubishi Triton
- Jeep Wrangler
- Suzuki Jimny

The supply is limited, especially for larger models, which means that the Land Cruiser 250 is expected to be as popular as the Prado.

Production numbers for the Land Cruiser 70 are about 400 units per month, approximately 5000 annually. The Land Cruiser 250 is projected to have an annual production of about 27,000 units. The production balance with the Land Cruiser 300 and Prado will need consideration as this supply situation could impact the market.

## Land Cruiser Supply Chain

The supply of the Land Cruiser series varies by model. The Land Cruiser 70 is produced at about 400 units per month, amounting to approximately 5,000 units per year. In contrast, the production volume for the Land Cruiser 250 is about 27,000 units annually, with an estimated 2,250 units produced monthly. Production figures for the Prado and Land Cruiser 300 are around 1,800 units monthly for the Prado, and between 1,000 and 2,000 units for the 300. This situation raises concerns about potential competition between the production lines of the 250 and other models, especially since they share production facilities.

### Dealer Inquiries

Inquiries to local dealers about the Land Cruiser 70 resulted in five contacts, and three for the 250, with none providing satisfactory responses.

> With this, Toyota Mobility Tokyo remains the only direct sales company. Established in April 2019 from the consolidation of five companies including Tokyo Toyota and Tokyo Toyopet, its sales in the fiscal year ending March 2020 were outstandingly high at 429.4 billion yen. As a special company conducting advanced initiatives, a sale to local entities is unlikely. Practically, Toyota has transferred all dealership operations to local capital.

Currently, Toyota Mobility Tokyo is the only direct sales outlet remaining, and while other regional dealers implement measures to prevent reselling, their effectiveness is questionable.

In fact, the Land Cruiser 70 has already appeared in the used car market at more than double its new price.

## Conclusion

![A photo of the LC250 that has rounded front lights](https://funailog.imgix.net/2024/landcruiser250-2.jpeg?auto=format,compress,enhance)

At this point, I am considering purchasing the Land Cruiser 250, although no decision has been made yet. A friend who already owns the Land Cruiser 70 (reissued in 2014) is participating in the lottery for the new model, and the outcome will influence my decision. Despite the carryover powertrain and significant price increase due to various factors, it would be nice to acquire this model.

Should I not succeed in the lottery, I will consider purchasing another vehicle model, which I have already largely reviewed.
